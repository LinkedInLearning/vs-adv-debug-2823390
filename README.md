This is the repository for the **LinkedIn Learning**  [Visual Studio - Advanced Debugging](#) course. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning](https://linkedin.com/learning/).

## Are you using all the debug tools?
Are you getting the most out of your Visual Studio debug sessions?  This course looks at several powerful debug tools that help pinpoint the problems in your application code; IntelliTrace, call-stack CodeMaps, remote debugging, multi-threaded tools and the interactive Diagnostics window. 
When activated, IntelliTrace captures and archives detailed debug sessions as they occur.  Later these sessions can be reloaded and replayed to analyze each historic step to find the elusive bug.
Use CodeMaps to visualize the relationships between .NET types and type members.  While debugging, build a dynamic code map of the live call stack.
View code stats and analyze debug information in the Diagnostics Tools debug window.  This one stop hub contains usable links to helpful tools and a live interactive view of the application performance metrics.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `chapter#-video#`. As an example, the branch named `02-03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Some branches will have a beginning state (`04-01`) and an end state (`04-01e`). The end state videos use `e` for "end" and contains the code as it is at the end of the video. The `master` branch holds the  initial state of the course and is not used for exercises during the course.
